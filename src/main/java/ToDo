* Implement a data structure
* we have website having several web-pages. And also there are lot many user who are accessing the web-site.
  say user 1 has access pattern : x->y->z->a->b->c->d->e->f
  user 2 has access pattern : z->a->b->c->d
  user 3 has access pattern : y->z->a->b->c->d
  user 4 has access pattern : a->b->c->d
  and list goes on for lot many users which are finite and numbered.
  Now the question is we have to determine the top 3 most occurring k-Page-sequence.
  for the above example result will be : (k=3) a->b->c , b->c->d , z->a->b.
